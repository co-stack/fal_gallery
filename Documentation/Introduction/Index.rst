Introduction
============

Notice
------

This project is a **free time** driven project.

What does it do?
----------------

FAL Gallery is a TYPO3 Extension that only relies on FAL Methods to build a gallery from a folder structure.
This Extension is the successor of wt_gallery and it does, like the old one, support EXIF data.

Main Features:

- Strictly relies on FAL only
- Gallery view: Browse in the folder tree
- List View: Show all supported images in the selected Gallery View
- Show View: Show the image selected in the List View

Configurable by the Editor in BE for all Plugins:

- Supported filetypes
- Thumbnail size
- Grids

Compatibility
-------------

This Extension is only tested with TYPO3 6.2.

Future
------

Features planned for future implementation:

- Preview of Images in "default image" selection
- Complete AJAX loading
- Javascript interface definition for safe extension update
- List View without Single View but with Light-/FancyBox
